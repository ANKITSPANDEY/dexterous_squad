<h3>üî• Your Pitch</h3>
In India, we observed that in last few years casualties due to Natural Calamities has increased in number and among all of them Lightning strike has emerged as the most fatal one. The records of 2015 in India justifies the fact that lightning has caused most no. of deaths (2641), amongst all other natural calamities. IMD statistical data death rate due to Lightning was 0.25 per million population per year in India. ( 1979-2011).
Hence, there is a serious requirement for a solution to this problem and after a no. of case studies we found a feasible solution for it. A single algorithm to actively monitor all the pincodes of our country calculating the occurrence probability of lightning strike in that area, and sending out alerts to the people via automated calls and sms in regional languages.
